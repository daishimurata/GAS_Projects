# The Antigravity Workflow

1. **Phase 1: Planning (Artifact Generation)**
   - Do NOT write code immediately.
   - First, output a "Master Plan Artifact" (a structured markdown design document) covering triggers, data structures, and function signatures.
   - Wait for user approval.

2. **Phase 2: Implementation**
   - After approval, generate code following `01_Antigravity_Rules.md`.
   - Always verify constraints (e.g., "Did I use batch operations?").

3. **Phase 3: Verification**
   - Suggest how to test the code locally using `gas-fakes` or how to verify it via a test run function.
